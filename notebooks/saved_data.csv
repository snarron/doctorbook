338,phrase,"A discipline is an integrated field of study in which there is some level of agreement about
                    the issues and problems that deserve study, how they are interrelated, how they
                    should be studied, and how findings or theories about the issues and problems
                    should be evaluated."
339,phrase,"A framework is a set of concepts that provide the basic structure for understanding a
                    domain, enabling a common vocabulary for different explanatory
                    theories."
340,phrase,"An organizing system is a collection of resources arranged in ways that
enable people or computational agents to interact with them."
341,phrase,"Resource has
                    an ordinary sense of anything of value that can support goal-oriented
                        activity. This definition means that a resource can be a physical thing , a non-physical thing, information about
                    physical things, information about non-physical things, or anything you want to
                    organize. Other words that aim for this broad scope are entity , object , item , and instance . Document is
                    often used for an information resource in either digital or physical format; artifact refers to resources created by people, and asset for resources with
                    economic value."
342,phrase,"Resource has specialized
                    meaning in Internet architecture. It is conventional to describe web pages,
                    images, videos, product catalogs, and so on as resources and the protocol for
                    accessing them, Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP , uses the Uniform Resource Identifier URI ."
343,phrase,"RFID computational agents Treating as a primary
                            resource anything that can be
                    identified is an important generalization of the concept because it enables
                    web-based services, data feeds, objects with RFID tags , sensors or other smart
                            devices or computational agents to be part of Organizing Systems."
344,phrase,"Many of the resources in
                    Organizing Systems are description
                            resources or surrogate
                            resources that describe the primary
                        resources ; library catalog entries or the list of results in web
                    search engines are familiar examples."
345,phrase,"Resources that describe, or are associated with other resources are
                    sometimes called metadata ."
346,phrase,"A collection is a group of resources that have been selected for some purpose. Similar terms
                    are set (mathematics), aggregation (data modeling), dataset (science and
                    business), and corpus (linguistics and literary analysis)."
347,phrase,"An index is
                    a description
                        resource that contains information about the locations and
                    frequencies of terms in a document collection to enable it to be searched
                efficiently."
348,phrase,"Intentional
                                arrangement emphasizes explicit
                    or implicit acts of organization by people, or by computational processes acting
                    as proxies for, or as implementations of, human intentionality. Intentional
                    arrangement excludes naturally-occurring patterns created by physical,
                    geological, biological or genetic processes."
349,phrase,"Self-organizing systems can
                    change their internal structure or their function in response to feedback or
                    changed circumstances."
350,phrase,"Organizing
                            principles are directives for the design or
                        arrangement of a collection of resources that are ideally expressed in a way
                        that does not assume any particular implementation or
                    realization."
351,phrase,"arranging resources
according to their names"
352,phrase,"arranging resources
according to the date of their creation or other important event in the
lifetime of the resource"
353,phrase,"It is highly desirable when the design and implementation of an
organizing system separates the storage of the resources from the
logic of their arrangement and the methods for interacting with
them. This three-tier architect is familiar to designers of
computerized organizing systems but it is also useful to think about
organizing systems in this way even when it involves physical
resources."
354,phrase,"Because tangible
                            things can only be in one place at a
                            time , many Organizing Systems — like
                        that in the modern library with online catalogs and physical collections — resolve
                        this constraint by creating digital proxies or surrogates to organize their tangible resources, or
                        create parallel digital resources like digitized books."
355,phrase,"The Organizing System
                        for a small collection can sometimes use only the minimal or default
                        organizing principle of collocation — putting
                        all the resources in the same container, on the same
                            shelf , or in the same email in-box."
356,phrase,"Some organization emerges implicitly through
                        a frequency of
                                use principle. In your kitchen or
                        clothes closet, the resources you use most often migrate to the front
                        because that is the easiest place to return them after using them."
357,phrase,"We use the more general
                        word, agent , for
                        any entity capable of autonomous and intentional organizing effort, because
                        it treats organizing work done by people and organizing work done by
                        computers as having common goals, despite obvious differences in
                        methods."
358,phrase,"agency A group of people can be an organizing agent , as when a
                        group of people come together in a service club or standards body technical
                        committee in which the members of the group subordinate their own individual
                        agency to achieve a collective good."
359,phrase,"RFID computational agents In some Organizing Systems the resources themselves are capable
                        of initiating interactions with other resources or with external agents ."
360,phrase,"An interaction is an action , function , service , or capability that makes use of the resources in a collection
                    or the collection as a whole. The interaction of access is fundamental in any collection of
                    resources, but many Organizing Systems provide additional functions to make access more efficient
                    and to support additional interactions with the accessed
                    resources. For example, libraries and similar Organizing Systems implement
                    catalogs to enable interactions for finding a known resource, identifying any resource in the
                    collection, and discriminating or selecting among similar
                    resources."
361,phrase,"We might treat circulation , borrowing and returning the
                            same item, as one of the interactions with resources that defines a
                            library."
362,phrase,"The original order of the
                    resources in an archive embodies the implicit or explicit Organizing System of
                    the person or entity that created the documents and it is treated as an
                    essential part of the meaning of the collection. As a result, the unit of
                    organization for archival collections is the fonds — the
                    original arrangement or grouping, preserving any hierarchy of boxes , folders , envelopes , and individual documents — and thus they are not
                    re-organized according to other (perhaps more systematic)
                    classifications."
363,phrase,"Curation usually refers to the methods or systems
                    that add value to and preserve resources, while the concept of governance more often emphasizes the
                    institutions or organizations that carry out those activities. The former is
                    most often used for libraries, museums, or archives and the latter for
                    enterprise or inter-enterprise contexts."
364,phrase,"Fortunately most users of Web 2.0 or community content applications at
                    least partly recognize that the organization of resources emerges from the
                    aggregated contributions of all users, which provides incentive to use less
                    egocentric descriptors and classifications."
365,phrase,"Classification is
                    applied categorization — the assignment of resources to a
                    system of categories, called classes, using a predetermined set of
                    principles."
